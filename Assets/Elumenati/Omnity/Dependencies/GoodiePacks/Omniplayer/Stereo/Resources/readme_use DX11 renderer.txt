NVISION Stereo combiner needs DX11.

You need to enable 3D in the nvidia settings.

set the stereo gap to be normal... you could experiment with it.

gApparentDepth are important to get right

4.1 is a good starting point.

 _ViewportOffset  should be 0 if flush to the left or the viewport fills the whole screen.
 
if you are rendering into a render texture buffer then 0 will work
if you are offset and not rendering into a render texture buffer than set the offset to be the offset of the viewport.x
0 or .5
